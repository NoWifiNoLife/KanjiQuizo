Making widets:

Frames: call Frame object
Buttons: call Button object
Text: call Label object

Placing things:
Frames can only be packed.
Buttons and text should be placed using grid.
grid works like excel, rows and column; if no parameters are set for row or column or both, then it is 0 be default.


Binding Functions:
First make the function:

	def showAnswer():
		print("something")
1. The function cannot have parameters passed. Because pressing a button won't be able to pass parameters

Add the "command" parameter to the button:

	button4 = Button(root, text="whatever", command= showAnswer)
1. Note the command doesn't contain parenthesis as not parameters can be passed

Alternatively, you can bind an "event" to the button by first adding event to the function, then:

	def showAnswer(event):
		print("something")

calling the bind function.

button4.bind("<Button-1>", showAnswer) #Button-1 means a left click on the button
